# Python Basics
**Project: Temperature Converter and Grade Checker**

## Overview

This repository documents my learning journey as a Python beginner. It covers the core concepts of Python Basics and includes a mini-project: Temperature Converter and Grade Checker, which helped me apply what I’ve learned in a practical way.

This project marks my transition from learning syntax to writing simple, functional programs.

## Part 1: Python Basics
During this learning phase, I focused on understanding the foundations of Python programming, including:

* **Python Fundamentals**
* Python syntax and indentation
* Writing and running Python scripts
* Using comments for code readability

* **Data Types**
* Integers (int)
* Floating-point numbers (float)
* Strings (str)
* Booleans (bool)

* **Variables**
* Declaring and assigning variables
* Naming conventions and best practices
* Reassigning variable values

* **User Input & Output**
* Using input() to collect user data
* Converting input strings to numbers using int() and float()
* Displaying results using print()

* **Operators**
* Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, **)
* Comparison operators
* Basic logical reasoning (<, >, <=, >=, ==, !=)

* **Control Flow**
* Conditional statements (if, elif, else)
* Making decisions based on user input

## Mini-Project: Temperature Converter and Grade Checker
**Project Description**

The Temperature Converter is a simple Python program that converts temperature values between:
1. Celsius
2. Fahrenheit

The Grade Checker program displays grade for different score bands from 1-100

These projects demonstrate how basic Python concepts can be combined to solve a real-world problem.

**Temperature Converter Features**
* Gives clear instructions on how to use the program.
* Accepts user input for temperature value
* Allows selection of conversion type:
    1. Celsius ➝ Fahrenheit
    2. Fahrenheit ➝ Celsius
* Performs accurate temperature calculations
* Displays the converted temperature clearly

**Grade Checker Features**
* Gives clear instructions on how to use the program.
* Accepts user input score from 1-100.
* Displays grade for score entered.

**Learning Outcomes**

Through this project, I was able to:

* Practice writing Python programs from scratch
* Apply control flow and user input handling
* Improve problem-solving skills
* Build confidence to start sharing projects on GitHub
* Learning markdown to write Readme file

## Part 2: Python Loops & Iteration
**Project: Largest so far, Smallest so far, Count, Sum, Average, Found**

## Overview

This session introduces Python loops and iteration through simple explanations and hands-on mini-projects that reflect how loops are actually used in practice.

Loops are one of the most important concepts in Python. They allow you to repeat actions, process data efficiently, and build real-world logic like sum, averages, searches, and so on.

During this learning phase, I learnt how and when to use the definite and indefinite loops which are:

* while (indefinite loop)
* for (definite loop)

## Mini-Project: Largest so far, Smallest so far, Count, Sum, Average, Found

* **Largest so far**
**Goal:** Find the largest number in a list.

* **Smallest so far**
**Goal:** Find the smallest number in a list.

* **Count**
**Goal:** Count how many items exist in a list.

* **Sum**
**Goal:** Add up all the numbers in a list.

* **Average**
**Goal:** Calculate the average of a list of numbers.

* **Found**
**Goal:** Check whether a value exists in a list.

**Happy coding!**
