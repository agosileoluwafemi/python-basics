# Python Basics
**Project: Temperature Converter**

## Overview

This repository documents my learning journey as a Python beginner. It covers the core concepts of Python Basics and includes a mini-project: a Temperature Converter, which helped me apply what I’ve learned in a practical way.

This project marks my transition from learning syntax to writing simple, functional programs.

## Part 1: What I Have Learned (Python Basics)
During this learning phase, I focused on understanding the foundations of Python programming, including:

* **Python Fundamentals**
* Python syntax and indentation
* Writing and running Python scripts
* Using comments for code readability

* **Data Types**
* Integers (int)
* Floating-point numbers (float)
* Strings (str)
* Booleans (bool)

* **Variables**
* Declaring and assigning variables
* Naming conventions and best practices
* Reassigning variable values

* **User Input & Output**
* Using input() to collect user data
* Converting input strings to numbers using int() and float()
* Displaying results using print()

* **Operators**
* Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /)
* Comparison operators
* Basic logical reasoning (<, >, <=, >=, ==, !=)

* **Control Flow**
* Conditional statements (if, elif, else)
* Making decisions based on user input

## Mini-Project: Temperature Converter
**Project Description**

The Temperature Converter is a simple Python program that converts temperature values between:
1. Celsius
2. Fahrenheit

This project demonstrates how basic Python concepts can be combined to solve a real-world problem.

**Features**
* Gives clear instructions on how to use the program.
* Accepts user input for temperature value
* Allows selection of conversion type:
    1. Celsius ➝ Fahrenheit
    2. Fahrenheit ➝ Celsius
* Performs accurate temperature calculations
* Displays the converted temperature clearly

**Learning Outcomes**

Through this project, I was able to:

* Practice writing Python programs from scratch
* Apply control flow and user input handling
* Improve problem-solving skills
* Build confidence to start sharing projects on GitHub
* Learning markdown to write Readme file
